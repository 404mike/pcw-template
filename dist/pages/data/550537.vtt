I'd rather look for men yeah and I'd rather work with men

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.300
it's not that they tell you

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.100
because men wouldn't appear we would win the work with them you know but

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.700
they were afraid especially me I was a bit of a character Mark

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.700
oh

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.200

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.100
and you mentioned before we started recording that you would have liked to have been a hairdresser yes or I'd love to I used to do hair when I was the youngster right

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.100
you know my

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.100
people around me to say well can you do my exercise to do my

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.400

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.200
and

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.900
I used to do the hair for them

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.400
yeah

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.800
so wasn't it an option then few to do hairdressing well you I couldn't afford to

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.800
because I mean you had to go to college when they are to bring my neon

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.000
you know so I did not much of a choice

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.500
super wanted to take or something wasn't possible wasn't a possibility you know so how did you feel about that

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I was a bit upset over that my mind later- than that

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910
so

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:10.100
how did you realize that that wasn't gonna happen when you were in school my name is in school yes so I thought well I won't be able to go to college because you want to go to college

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.400
oh gorgeous somebody that will train you

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.300
up and that's in there wasn't that many people as you take you on anyway yeah you know

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.800
so

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.000
we didn't have a choice

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.600
yeah

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:21.700
so what

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.200
do you think

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.700
you were going to end up doing then you didn't know what

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.200
not really

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.700
facts because it's all it was in them and he was there yeah

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.400
you know

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:38.000
feel about the money had you heard that the money was good because the factory menu where else yeah

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.800
to shop with or anything like that it was good

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.300
and you had to listen again if an adult

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.100
in the shop they

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.700
used to have Tuesday afternoon and that does it

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.800
because I will send these weak in the shop you have the hours for a long shot I used to wash the floors in the shop

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.300
on the Sunday and queen on the Sunday she'd make me dinner

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.200
and I'd have to sit in there

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.500
shopping images

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.200

where was that anybody bought all right

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.300
but your mother got you that job but she yes I mean well another used to shop there and she was a friend of it because I think my mother work for her mother

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.300

because when you're young you don't want that no you don't know no no

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.700
alright to go back to when you started a Morris Motors then

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:49.600
you knew somebody working then something that you've got your interview yes Austin it's my uncle got me in there so you were 16 when you say yes 1770 yes and can you remember your first day you

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:50.900

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:52.900
it's

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.900
frightened to death

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.900
I was fighting to death

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.400
no people

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.400
look in there yes but there was so many different

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.500
departments

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.900
because you want the

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.100
Wellington you are there

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.900
sorry new at the car eaters

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:10.900
so it

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.600
you didn't know where you were going to go

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.200
so when I first started there

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.900
you should I have to go to a school

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.400
but instead of sending me to the school they give me one of the four men

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.300
and you said I'll show you up

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.300
so he trained me up

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.200
as well all right

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.200

and he said we are good today you know get on the job

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.500

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.000
so I said she was in this other chaps that's when you fancy know I said the wrong way

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.800
and then he goes that's why I went down to them

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.100
and they stick with emotions yeah

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:38.100
gosh you didn't fancy have it another look around there's a little look around yes

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.400
we both did because we didn't stick together for a

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.000
like we started going out and then we split up

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.600
yeah you're young though and yes but we went back and

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.200
yes that's to them

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.600
when most of us did but most of Us come out either

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.900
there's a very um

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.100
well you thought you did not you will quit socializing with them

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.300
because you had the clamp you used to go to the clamp

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.400
which was in the canteen at the time

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.300
to go to the dance

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.600
so you know we were with the workmates all the time

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.300
did you used to go to the club when you were 17 then yes you could go you could go then yeah

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.900
you must watch the drink but you could go there yeah

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.500
but you must have monitoring yeah

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.600
tell you that

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:28.500
work with

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.200
that would do one you will be well again salen says I was reading

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.100
and different cars

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.300
you said it was peaceworks so whatever you're done

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.600
I say we were getting here

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:42.900
silencer

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.100
yeah

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.500
so how many we could draw

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.400
it down then we start a little bit more to have

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.500
so they were talking to them oh yes no it doesn't really attack it

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.100
well you could say that you could say there was attacking because you are to do so much

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.600
before you at your

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:03.900
piece right level

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.700
so you would have to do a 20

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.700
and then you piece of excited

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:17.100
so how did you feel about once you got going with the work did you feel happy there because you'd have the food jobs previously yeah they've been hard work yes

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.500
but working in the factory was hard it was hard work

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.900
but we are something

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.700
we did that fun

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.300
and used to get your brakes

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.300
you know

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.200
something I wasn't useless oh

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.700
you should get you you know

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.800
well I'd record it if the shop was like

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.000
if they're all day

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.100
I used to get the bread and in the morning

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:39.500
then

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.700
I'd save in the shop all day then clean up before I went to warm

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.800
clean the fridge is out it was add work

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.700
because it was only me and nearly 80 there

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.700
when a doctor and again

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
it was just something that you enjoyed that yes

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.800
some of them are bullies their main

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.100
without you where bullies

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.100
like everywhere this was but um

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.400
did you get fully do you think no no

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.400
I didn't think so

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.900
they they couldn't get it not the boys couldn't with me

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:20.800
because I think what it was I grown up with voices as well like river but two boys younger than me yeah and I looked after them

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600
so I think it just

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.200
I was the boss I was the boss of the girl so they were older

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.000
so I think I've always been the one that was

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.000
when you talk about bullying though with the older women bullying younger girls are what was it

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.100
no they

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.800
it wasn't really bully and it just trying to show that authority you know show that they were

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.800
better than you like you know yeah

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.400
I like my mother always taught me there's nobody better than you and there's nobody above you

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.000
you're all equal

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:56.800
but that's a good thing to teach your dog because it was a Sunday school teacher at one time yeah and she's always answer

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.700
my mother she was a very

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.000
mmm

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.800
trump properly you know

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.700
my father was totally different that's what I come from

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.500
my father was a character

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.700
so when you talk in about these girls want to be top dog then is it yes

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.800
and they couldn't get to you but

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.300
did you see examples of them

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.000
being able to get to yes so I had some shot them out if I seen the Japanese

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.800
I'd be on to them what type of thing would you see happening

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:32.600
and

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.400
for like jelly then that they couldn't do certain things so

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.800
say there was a job now we can't go on that job

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.600
that's my job when I used to tell him it's nobody's job with us there

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.600
the chicken

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.600
if there was over time and things like that

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.000
you know just

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.700
to tell them you know you can't do that to them

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:55.400
because

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.900
I've always been very unionized

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.800
oh of you oh yes and very militant person like that

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.200
I don't like somebody be in Rhodes home

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.100
so I I'd be the one to tell that I was always in the office

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.200
I'm always there

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.800
something went wrong

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.900
some of my friends will tell you I used to go to the office for them

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.600
because they were afraid to talk

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.200
you wouldn't go to shops do you recorded in the end yeah but that's

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.700
they just asked me for you and I wouldn't do it and I'm sorry you know

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.800
what did was I'm

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.400
I'm not very cold there to straighten

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.400
I got spelling is

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.800
yours my dad say yes

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.100
but putting it down on paper no way

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:46.000
because I can't even write a letter today god asked my sister in order to write a letter maybe because I'm useless

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:53.000
well everybody's different on things because he used to send my brother lives in Australia where I had two brothers living with pain yeah

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.700
and he's a calm you got because they both say you're all right just letters you know yeah so I'd write the letters

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.900
then I found my brother and I'd say about my letter

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.900
which I can come back from the defects decide for us

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.600
speak

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.200
yeah

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.900
so do you think that went against you in Morris more yes yeah because it could have been a full moon

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.500
yeah I was asked to become a full woman there yeah

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.400
I don't need it one points

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.300
like one of the girls was off

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.200
and they asked me if I take over

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.100
you know

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.700
no I said I'm not doing it

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.900
but I tell you what's under why show some of the ice

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.900
the jobs because I mean I knew most of the jobs that same

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.600
I said I show them the jobs but she left to do the right thing

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.800
all right then so I done that for a while

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.100
I could say yeah

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.300
it's interesting it's what it was

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.200
that used to get to me sometimes

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.000
that's to think we didn't

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.800
I stay at school and learn them

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:07.000
yeah but some people just don't like school for whatever reason isn't it no well it's just like

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.300
how did you find the work difficult in school yes

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.900
but nobody talking about

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.700
because I'm going to tell you a little story now my father

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.400
my father had classes like bottle bottoms

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.500
srijani glasses for years of my father couldn't read your right

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:27.400
so we took game to the opticians

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.100
we had many so I thought chicken was see what it

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.400
and their children he's not um

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.700
wasn't as I said in the beginning and then they don't think

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.500
he was a little threat

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.500
and they hadn't picked it up

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.600
because he was saying he couldn't do something yeah oh get glasses put in

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.400
so in the end of the glasses like that's really cool at least c

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.900
yeah he was especially blamed

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.600
you know so

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.300
often because people didn't signal disabilities didn't take notice a me in school yeah

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.100
I think you know I wouldn't do nothing I'd have to go outside and sit

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:05.100
yeah

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.700
it's different now oh yes

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.300
I learned more coming out to school and then I learned in school

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.300
and my son

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:20.800
was it wasn't just like you I was it or when I think it was because yeah because they don't diagnose that back then when I was the right place

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.300
I used to add letters

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.000
because you know in a way to do where bills in

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:27.900
the shop

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:28.700
yeah

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.300
I have to also if I would like to know I don't need

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.500
yeah at the end

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.300
I should do stupid things like that

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.800
not really know when I was doing it yeah

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.800
you know and stupid things that used to be

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.500
and I could see it after that if somebody showed me

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.700
but at the time I thought I didn't drive

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:48.110
so

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.400
take this next year I suppose

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:52.400
but if you

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.100
you know if you should be going to school now you know what helps you what's up

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:56.800
because

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:02.500
the thing is about people a lot of people were dyslexic they've got very good

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.200
skills in other areas yes yeah

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.500
yeah they have

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:16.300
so why do you think you are strengths well when you were working now we're more a small does because you could obviously do the work I could do the work I could pick up on it most jobs they put me on a job

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.800
I could do it within a couple of minutes for somebody I should take a nap back in

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.000
yeah but I used to see things you know

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.300
because I've had a few

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.600
I've got one in there now what I made my knee

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.000
because I put an idea I used to have good idea yes

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.500
because if I see something know like um

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.600
say they're using it for instance a plug for your now

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.600
and they actually take this plug away from

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.800
to do it and it was cost them a fortune because they'd have to stop the job

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.700
well they told them why don't you put it on

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:47.800
pipes

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.800
are pipes because they were here

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:50.500
things

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.400
get to spare one

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.100
and then get too much you can put this one on

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.800
playing to them what to do it

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.800
next thing they came back I had 40 pounds I think got it

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.200
big deal same 10 million

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.800
and that's what they would they then and that's a bit worked

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.400
three years after yeah

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.100
the same as one of the doors

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.100
the doors were jamming on one of them

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.500
oh what you call them places

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.200
you couldn't get them fixed they wouldn't do it for 11 or many

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.900
so much I had an idea put a band on it

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:25.800
because it wouldn't

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:33.000
come back yeah so what I did I was putting bands and then yeah so in the other day and so when the gauge open

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.900
the elastic would pull it back

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.200
so that is another one of my ideas

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.400
you know what college

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.700
they did acknowledge yeah but you didn't get nothing for it no

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.000
you know very poor yeah

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:56.400
same with this and but like I have seen I couldn't write it on paper yeah so nothing people licking your ideas yes yes you did

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.300
because if you have said something to somebody they put it in

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.100
and they'd get money for it

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.600
the bad happened

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:10.200
we're not to me about do one of the other boys because I had told him what to do yeah I wasn't putting the idea in myself but he did

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.200
and he went and told somebody else

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.000
I need and

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.900
that's

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.700
but it's all about not being able to put it down a bit there yeah

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.800
you know because we were the most there's no good Telephone Man

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.100
they couldn't charge somebody else

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.700
because that's what they used to do the engineer would come and not

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.300
I just energy at the end

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.600
so it was really magnan

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.000
to accept your ideas though because you know

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:45.400
you're a woman and stuff they didn't think or does she thinks she is yeah in the beginning they did

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.300
but like I'm saying I'm a bossy

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.400
bitch

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:49.800
and I am

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.300
so if they didn't

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.500
listen to me I'd make them listen

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.500
you know why I really

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.000
lay into them

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:58.610
but

00:21:59.100 --> 00:21:59.400
to

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.400
take the except it

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.500
the actual then yeah I'd have them by the short and clear leaves

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.300
and that was literally

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.500
so when you went

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.200
to work there was there anyone else from

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:12.800
your family

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.200
work in there yes because we're working there

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.700
my young girls

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.000
and my sister just finished she and long finish their

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.300
so why did she go to then

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.500
did you go back to the optical all right

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.100
yeah I think that's what she went did she go to a shop

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:41.200
what did she finish what she finished up the baby oh baby cuz they have to finish you have to finish I had to finish

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.500
because I lost a lot to say this threat

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.000
yeah

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.300
that's not fair though it wasn't fair it wasn't fair then

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.100
I think it just two or three years later

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.100
they brought it in that you could come back to work oh right

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.700
yes I had my boy in 1971

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.400
related to finish home when I went back to you later and I had to go back on party time

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:02.800
yeah

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.100
well they work part time for 5 years

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:10.200
and then they used to let you off in between you know or would you don't need you today and

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.500
did they just

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.900
tell you myself then yeah it's just about telling us about time

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.100
so then it came I was made full time then they

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.200
made me just Returns once again then

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.100
because we were the last in then

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.500
but of course this week we're at longer than I'd love it longer than getting that long run

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.200
but I had to finish because it was broken service

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.500
yeah so I just met in that way yeah otherwise in mine because I had my lovely boy

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.300
you know what the end of it

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.400
didn't worry

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.200
I know nobody's in first and fair very unfair yeah

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:50.000
because you do suffer financially yes don't you because there was one girl she had to baby

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.800
and the father wouldn't say he was the father

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:53.900
yeah

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.200
but they kept it on because you didn't

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.300
it just

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:57.700
you know

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.000
good for it

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.700
but it wasn't very nice for us no

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.700
because we had fathers told children

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.700
yeah you know but we still have to have them in here

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.500
she did have but she wasn't they weren't sure when you know

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.800
she kept her job she was there 40 years later

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.000
you know

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.800
really Mad Men yeah because if you've got to roll it's got to apply to everybody

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.000
yeah

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.500
grew up

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:38.300
do you know working in the laundry and then in the shop but then in the factory what did other thing other people think what we're acted tunes towards people working in Morris Motors

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:38.900
do you think

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:39.500
oh

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.200
these were them

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.900
were very nice people

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.300
because we used to swell in the factory

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:47.600
well

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.000
if you didn't swear when part of the factory

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.300
and that was

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.400
every day thing if you were in the factory and you'd

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.400
say somebody told it on you go

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
f of you know

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:00.400
it just

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.600
occurred in thing because when I went to a month and Collins

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.500
said something in the old some of this I don't bring that language on yet

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.200
because they never saw

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.300
I would tell you our father

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:12.500
is there

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.000
something in there then yes

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.200
because we didn't

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.100
need it

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.100
but once you went to the factory you did all the time

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.100
and you know how to

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:22.900
use it yet

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.300
like this to say you can get away with it

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.800
nobody has to because I used to say it in such a

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.400
call because I don't know

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.500
that I used to say it but

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.900
the others couldn't get away with him if my sister come on and say that and I mean

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:41.700
all the end

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.100
jealous then about you know girls work tomorrow does because

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:53.700
you know you're on

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.900
good money then yes or we don't take him any

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.400
do you think other people are jealous

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.200
God in

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.100
although

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.500
saying that I didn't we didn't know many people have said the factory because it is all

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.100
all less reworking in the factory on my friends were getting out of this time

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.500
so when you saw Sheila then you saw it with them then with the work guys

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.700
yeah you know

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.300
and because I mean we were

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.100
I think we were 2000 girls working there that at that time

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.900
you know which is a lot of

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.500
because it was more good it's a men there

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.300
very few men were there is that then

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.600
I think it was because it was

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.000
I think remember better than men

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.400
not be in

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.900
thing but men I think they were afraid of the men to bring them into the factory

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.500
otherwise he worked my mind some of it just

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.600
but I think they were afraid of the men

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.700
but that same

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.700
employee in more than and

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.900
his friends don't need to love to the menu

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.400
I think sure

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.300
because men no more militant than women as well and one day

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.900
you know men wouldn't accept something additions we will work in

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.300
so the work was heavy though was what was everywhere

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.900
I heard a few people say yeah yes

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.200
what was crazy and especially when I went on the seats

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.000
I was lifting 40 pounds seats

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.600
you know and throw in them around as if they want a thing up for today for it now

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:31.200
and how'd you think yourself alright

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.800
and I don't know when to accidents you know that

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.000
I've never claimed from the start I had some

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.000
bangs that you think will

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.800
but today you can feel them

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.600
yeah you know

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.200
think oh wait

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.800
anything warm it's about that when it was working because he used to put things

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.800
changing things and then did you like

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.100
are you Rich around and you know this is when you're on the seats on the seats

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.000
most clear

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.100
a lot of the things that I normally see

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.500
that when I was on the seats when we do a complete seat from started finish

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.300
as you can imagine now we used to do the flame

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.900
or depends now what job you would on you do the frame

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.700
come from the pressure up you have all

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:13.900
like

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.000
posts and

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.000
we join all these up together

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:18.400
and you

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
put them into a frame

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.100
well in them all and every sites

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.700
sometimes they could be up to 15 20 well so on the

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.300
seats but if you were on the final vinyl then you do all this

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.700
and then you check it out then it was another person and they put the

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:35.600
springs on

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.200
you know and then put them up dresses on them

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:39.200
and

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.000
you you with your camera around like this

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:43.500
honey would you win

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.100
1450

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.500
another way yeah you know

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.800
it is a lot yeah

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:51.510
so

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.100
where the men working on that line

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.800
where we did have a few

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.900
yes they started bringing in

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:58.700
on that plane

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.600
but it doesn't sleep with men

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.200
mostly when men

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.400
work was there a bus or have whenever you started there

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.200
it's Sunday if I missed it and get the manager to take me and

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:17.200
because he lived in the reports all right well that's handy so you surrender to the top roads

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.200
and used to tell me anyways very

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.500
iration was

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.200
Mr boss again I can't take exactly not

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.700

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.300
and let's say yeah all the way said

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:31.900
used to tell him

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.300

and I went down to them

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.300
shopping for women

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.600

yeah

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:05.500
you know

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:06.800
I've already said that

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.000
we would shy then if I wasn't sure you know I don't think I will show you

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.100
but not when to

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.000

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:43.700
that many

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.800
because what you used to go on there was a

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.000
great

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.100
this is to see something so

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.200
what's somebody going on for somebody else yes carry on Zen

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.700
people getting pregnant and putting them down the toilet and

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.700
never yes it is a bit

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.500
of course that is yeah isn't it oh yeah she's just you don't

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.800
have business like I said it doesn't mind

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:12.200
yeah

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.500
yeah he wanted to do it yeah carry on

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.900
where was the girls from then which areas to recommend they were

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.100
but report there was a lot of them ready Port

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:25.300
from Southern

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:26.800
Pennsylvania

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.700
we had some drum because I know

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.300
they were some

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.100
various area for it yeah

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.100
you know they were quite a vast area

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.400
was it no easy there or just really nice here

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.600
very nice you are just shout

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.200
that's why I think ain't no shouts today

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.200
because it's it was if you didn't share with you anyway

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.800
but could you talk or YouTube busy anyway

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.300
oh no your child but you want your show to talk yeah

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:02.300
you know

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.200
that's right most people have got cleaned in today yeah

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:11.900
but obviously successful though because it's difficult to prove it I as a job to prove my add it

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:20.000
I'm talking about 10 years ago I put in my claim I don't do it now all right but I had to put it in 10 years ago because I thought I had to damage

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.800
Grom made something wrong with that

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.500
well it wasn't just realising Alicia

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.300
but I'd be in

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.100
the union for a while

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.300
and they told me then the Gorge was a problem

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.800
so I thought well I could never know when it's in the internet

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.700
so when I went to the general and they told me no

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.600
you got a damn mission of Duty nice and relation is nothing we can do about it

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.400
so how to start affect you today I'm gonna get terrible in the chest

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.000
or do you

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.000
and I can't talk to anybody

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.900
without seeing the case I've got to look for somebody okay you talk to me now and send it away

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:02.500
I can't really hear you I can hear you but I wouldn't be able to make out exactly what you say in yeah

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.200
so you are you literally a lot

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.300
especially when we go out in the ground

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:14.800
yeah no if you go down a big table yeah and then like this if the chocolate I can't hear you

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:15.600
you know

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.199
it's bad it's in Israel

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.400
like I'm saying I have my client 10 years ago president of more today if I added today

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.699
oh it's done now it's standing now yes there's nothing to worry about

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.500
girls lip read while they were working yes yeah

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.900
because I've heard somebody else yes you are doing what you're watching then

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.300
you know because of the ways you wouldn't be able to work

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.000
understand what they were seeing because you imagine the bang in was going on there

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.900
because you'd have somebody plugged in by the side of

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.600
you opening them

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.300
things for you to Wales

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.000
silencers are diffused well some things

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.400
so the noise anything of your ears so we never had nothing then there was no

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.100
never even know

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.900
existed I don't think then

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:04.800
wearing them

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.100
do you have a uniform

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:07.600
clean over

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.200
here

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.200
this way and then you know

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.800
we had a friend zone

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.000
just stop the well from her new can't let's

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.100
or when we were Castrol do we added

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.200
by zero face there's no one of these

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.100
goggles we had a niger thing up here

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.700
as we have on spots

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:30.700
on your feet

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.500
or they did give you that equipment mine

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.900
but you are to buy your gloves

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:36.000
oh did you

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.300
must cheeky yeah

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.000
but they were giving you the money back when they say in your divide them

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.700
but you will get in it back in your pee

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.200
yeah

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.900
so you were painting a penny for them

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.300
you'll get it back and you pay then

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.200
because I think they thought people were wasting and yeah so I think it was a way of controlling at them

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.500
which is called jeze yeah

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.000
the

00:35:59.200 --> 00:35:59.300
world

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.100
is dangerous at all then

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:02.500
yes

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.600
you didn't think it did the time but it was

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
because one of the girls

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.200
went around

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.900
because we had a few Explosions there but the gas because it was

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.100
bottle at the time but then they put it on mains

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.300
so they're just flow into everybody

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.100
well what's up

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.400
as it was just a new thing and the

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.200
it blew back

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.500
somebody went to lamp one they must have I have a pocket in it

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.200
blew back to the center girl

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.700
because I had to

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.400
and I was kind of my body at the time

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.500
well he had to jump over there can be used to get me

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.300
because I was in the middle and I didn't even knew a jets

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.500
so they jumped over the care to get me but it's only got

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.000
the stronger and it all gone

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.400
we shouldn't laugh for no

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.800
but she loved it here I think she had a lot of black on it

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.600
oh probably yeah

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.400
so of course

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.000
yes flour yeah

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.900
she must have gone to Wales at the same year and

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:00.500
so this is

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.400
lovely

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:04.200
get any

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.000
comfort you think

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.100
I don't know she must have

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.300
I didn't clean anything man

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:14.400
but I suppose it didn't think to clear from Miami

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.400
he said

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.400
yes I got me I'm in a convenience so I had to claim for that 100 pound

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:20.910
oh

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:28.600
that's a lot of money in their days so what happened should I go to the convey yeah and we complained about this can be able to long time

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.600
you're supposed to put the other silencers on not too well in them

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.200
and we used to them

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.400
thing on for the space if there can be it wouldn't take them if you would win too many

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.500
we had a conversion and

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.000
like a stand on the Cambria

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.200
will it we just enjoyed them on

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.800
oh no we can't do that we come to that

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.100
we watch it happens where the Silence is run this

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.300
things did this stands

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.800
my arm had gone in there now to put sailors on because I was checking them on the convey yet

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.100
and the other ones that have gone and jammed underneath

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.500
brought it over and so

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:05.600
come down on my hand

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.600
so I am was being dragged down now

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.400
with this thing and the convenient nobody could stop it

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.300
so I buy the same thing they came I pass them to anyway

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:17.900
did it break

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:18.600
no

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.200
they they couldn't get over there was adding drop

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.100
I was Black and Blue mine

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.200
but they couldn't understand that we didn't break

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:26.700
strong

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:28.700
TEFL Birds

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.500
did they take safety seriously then

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.700
because I know not really then

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.600
because when they're in Chicago because they had

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.600
lucky I didn't see it the end

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:42.600
stretcher

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.900
they went to get the stretch of the wall

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.100
put me on it

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.500
when you pick it up

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.900
let's stretch your heart was still on the floor here

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.200
that's all set you consciously where they went even check in the equipments

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.200
so the two boys that picked me up

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.600
I think both of them are dead never love them

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.600
and when was on the only end

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.300
and they were active in which side they were going to pick up

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.700
was gonna love my legs and who's gonna make it

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.000
and there was a big argument between them

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.000
so I think by the time my god

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.100
come back

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.000
they were still alive given

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.800
oh just so friendly

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.100
which Union was it in the factory

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:28.300
hmm

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.400
transport just transmit in general

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.200
when I first started they were used to pay it down in the toilet

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.600
because they didn't recognise the Union

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:43.000
no it came in there with that be now 1967

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.900
didn't recognise that you didn't regulations yeah

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:48.700
but it was

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.400
it has to be a closed shop then

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.000
yeah

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.700
you know everybody had to be in there so I think

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:58.200
what did was to do is a bit of there's a bit of conflict at that time yeah

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.100
so they don't need them and I think it just 19

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.500
so what's took

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:04.800
the

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.500
shop you would take in the many other toys

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:13.000
I'm not sure whether it is a 5.0 source and I could have actually gone there

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:16.500
got a penny

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.200
yeah good to be in a penny

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:24.100
but what did the manager say then they must have known that yes they knew what it but they're not going to say anything

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
you know they wouldn't say it well it was not much management there then

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.100
no you only had one big manager

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.600
then you would for men

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.900
you would win superintendent that was over the factory now like today

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.800
you know so you didn't have that many

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.200
managers

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:52.600
there and then with the charge hands or something as well yes for men are they were the four men we've got them for men were they men and women yes yes they would

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.800
we are two women over rest or three three sorry there's no

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.000
Academy the other ones name

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.300
know so they were chances to go on to be

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.800
oh yes for for women because I was asked to become one yeah yeah

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.400
like I say if I just the paperwork could just have with me if I could have done the paperwork

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.800
and even more step I know yeah I'm sure you want yeah

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.800
because I never Blake jobs and something it was just that

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.200
didn't us then

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:32.800
no

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.600
not really because

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.800
I had fun to win it you know

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.700
I should take place in my work

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.000
I'm the quick guide I could go and do it perfect the better I think

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:47.900
yeah and you couldn't moment and they could learn more money yeah until they stopped the Beast work

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.600
cuz you know like you're saying you obviously got really

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.700
high practical skills yeah too

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:03.100
but some people are hopeless I'd be hope yes so we did have some minor

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.400
we like I trained again yeah I was terribly

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:07.900
should never suppose

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.400
but but if I seen some of these luck and I couldn't help them

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:15.200
focusing them couldn't do it because I drained a lot of people are

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.400
trained my mother very loved one

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.400
because she used to cast my mother didn't know we did before me

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.300
well I trained because the gas must finish in

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.500
so I trained that to see her too well

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.100
which anybody wants to People Like did you get

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:30.400
extra

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:30.810
money

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:32.700
well yes

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.200
when I put in fresh you should get you put in fruits

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.400
because I was having so much fun to win it

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.200
I should work as well answering them yeah

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.500
oh they were going to the menu

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.300
if I never had another thing you know they've had met

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.900
they got good for years old to me then

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.000
talking about management earlier

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.000
and you were saying they were very few

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.300
managers there at the Beginning is that

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:01.700
something through then

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.900
yes it did all right why is that

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.400
then I don't know I think

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.800
we had one big manager

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.400
and then I think there was one for each of the sections

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.800
but then you add a manager

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.100
you what is

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.300
understood you which was

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.300
what they call them I forget what they call them now

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.100
we're gonna end the manager yes yes and the managers when you are

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:26.700
but

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.300
when I finished up there

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.600
you would simply jezz and

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.800
lately jazz and Lane features and

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:34.700
you think

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.600
that was a necessary I think it's I think it's really stupid

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.200
the idea of that was Japanese

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.200
they went to them to do

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:43.400
like

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:46.000
work

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.900
take over and some juice going off the lane

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.000
and things like that

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.300
and that's what they should have been doing

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.700
but they weren't they took it you see yes

00:43:58.700 --> 00:43:59.300
you know when they were

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.200
to win on there

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.500
sitting back and letting you to everything

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.700
but if you go and sell them look I got

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:07.400
what go and

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.600
no look at you

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:12.400
really

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.200
so I think it was an excuse they get paid a lot as well

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.700
for not contributing that much oh don't you

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:27.500
know yes it's a big wage to pay for this it's not actually producing anything and I think there's an engineer today

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.300
all right because if it works in Japan it doesn't look beer

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:31.700
no

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.100
sorry

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.500
yeah people's net

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.300
so what their skilled

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.200
jobs there and then skilled job so with the different degrees

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:41.900
of

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.300
needed for different jobs there

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.800
well you could have done your training I could have gone on to do when

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:51.800
special skills in Wellington

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.600
Legend quite happy doing what I was doing

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.000
why is that but then

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:57.810
but

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.400
at the end of the day we would always want the same job anyway and they didn't

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.800
I don't think they recognise that there

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.500
but you could have gone somewhere else to do everything

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.500
and not make well daemon

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.500
court then

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:13.800
you know you

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.400
some of the boys could have gone on to do that

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.800
and saying are some of the boys came they recorded until we're not in a job

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.500
so I don't think it makes any difference but

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.900
still make good money yes yeah

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.300
they want to print is there with her yes there was a princess as they thought

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:33.500
tool sets in

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.100
electricians

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.600
fitters

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.100
yeah so we're going to feel when they were always boys for they

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:44.500
young boys and girls

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:47.100
beautiful

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:48.000
yeah

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:57.000
but that's not something that would have appealed to you if no no no it's been different no no no no I was quite happy doing what I was doing yeah

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.900
because I went on to do different jobs then after they release information

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:02.600
I went on to sold it in

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.000
in a way enjoyed so if they didn't

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.300
which job did you enjoy the best then

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.600
out of all the jobs of all the jobs did there

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:16.200
well let's see each of the Wellington I enjoyed wellton because I was going to set

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:17.300
you know yeah

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:19.600
so enjoy doing it

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:22.900

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.800
men and the women get on then during

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.400
oh pretty good

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:33.000
because everything they are the married one another anyway yeah you know they were quite

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:37.500
but they a lot of them had met their then partners there yeah

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:38.400

number three pound map when you first started but like I'm seeing you what I'm a piece work yeah when she would send me your

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:38.400
six weeks

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:43.200
you had six weeks training as they call it but they must you did not then

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.400

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:45.500

but like I'm saying you what to do so much before you could claim me a piece well yeah

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:50.600
I

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:53.400
can't remember if you want to pay you guys is regularly then

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.100
we'll we were putting in for them every year

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.100
we didn't we go to the straight

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.200
yeah we were

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.200
like I'm serious strikes

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:03.000
yes

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:07.300
what are the adults usually it's just too hot there

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:09.500
because you wouldn't work in the heat

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:13.200
and they wouldn't give you nothing because used to give a short tablets to insane

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.800
and if they didn't give you anything they woke up

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:23.600
out so everything will be on top everything we are stopped which is too cold The Food would call you up the shops the word

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.000
no there's more or less than

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:31.100
either the boys or whatever but you would see the shops do what you tell him you're

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.700
going to be one needs say

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:34.300
but we love to go

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.800
you know we love to see about it yeah

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.700
we don't walk out get the manager went down to see you

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.000
talk about it if they didn't like it right I received tomorrow

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.200
and that's a Retros

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.900
do you have however then we did we had the power went yeah

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.100
it doesn't work as at the same days not like today

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:53.600
and I think

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:55.900
a lot do they be young there's a let go

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:56.500
yeah

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.900
because the youngsters are too afraid to lose their jobs

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.700
which is fair enough I think

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.000
there's no jobs to go to today is there

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:06.110
no

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.100
but I felt I feel sorry for them because they're like 10

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.200
the word clue lamp but we didn't

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:15.700
we roll the work

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.000
and we were transfer it's

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.500
they were getting in as well as this so

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.300
it is pretty good

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:41.800
so how would you when you first started their you were very young how did you spend your money did you give some at home more oh yes you had to get started many at all didn't give your pay package your mother though because some girls I don't give the whole paper no no no pocket no I never said that and I never will

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.600
I wouldn't do it in my old man then I want to return anybody

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.900
noise to tell him what your hands and I'd give her so much a week

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.000
well I actually keep so much back for the swear yeah

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:54.100
and if I spent my best villager children to walk very often

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:58.700
so that is my look outside never asked him and his mother for opinion

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.700
when I was giving any money back

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.200
because she tell me where to go I think

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.200
but if I didn't have my own best friend

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:08.900
it was my thoughts and I'd have to be penalised

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.600
I get to accept my mind

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:16.900
there's the Middle East but your social life at the time was around the factory more or less yes

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.100
so what what type of thing

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.300
what type of

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.500
events did they have on what we'll we call chip

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.700
they do organized trips seven of the girls so

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.900
we're joking is a trip and we'll go to go say no

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.000
anyway like that's one and C

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.900
so the girls themselves at all organizations

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:46.200
Christmas party or something you don't know you said what you said

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.000
alright

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.800
we should take balls into work we did

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:53.000

00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.600
by the end of it they joined in the party and I'm a clock in the morning

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.500
midgets

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.700
yeah

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:07.700
was

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:08.500
that herk's

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.100
for working in the fuk J

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.600
yes you'd get your Silence is cheap burn

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.900
you know we could have things cheaper yeah get your car's cheaper

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.000
did you find you couldn't afford it

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:21.600
no

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.800
he's saying that new attack was um

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.300
370 pound

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.100
you know that would be

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:33.300
equivalent for us to spend then

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:37.800
so we couldn't afford it but I mean to be cheap but then it's in the garage like

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.300
I can't do it normally

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:41.000
I was able

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.600
25% cheaper something like that

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:45.800
silly wouldn't afford it

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.200
you know if I could look forward to it I'm sure I couldn't afford the car

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:54.500
but why couldn't you afford bus for them we spending all your money I spent women or something else

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:56.300
like what clothes stop games

00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:00.600
they stopping so what it is okay

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:04.300
you know so

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.700
when everything's like that you know

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.800
cigarettes and smoke it

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:10.700
did

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:12.800
a lot of the girls small yes most of them

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:18.400
most of the girls smoking them stick them days and they always spin for a

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.900
cigarette then

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:25.000
could you couldn't just go you couldn't sleep where you were working could you smoke on the job

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.800
yes because smoking the job then you'd ever get it for that

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.900
you're lucky he didn't go up for that girl's hey now yeah

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:37.100
oh no he's just smoking the fact that he then there was nothing and they didn't mind that no

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:43.900
well I suppose it was benefiting there was no it's never been an issue because I mean the four men would walk around the fucking his mouth

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.600
yeah it's never been in this year when we're concerned

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:47.500
there's

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.500
smoking come in yeah

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:53.200
do you think that they were that

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.000
the the bosses were fair

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.900
do you think they were Gordon employers

00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.500
some of them were

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:02.500
I don't think

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.200
I like it like I say I like the bosses he was lovely but

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.100
I might be cheeky to them as well man

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.700
I wouldn't let them get away with anything yeah

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.400
but I think you're better off if you change your if you're a bit

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.400
nervous of them yes

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:22.700
yeah

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:24.900
oh my god I'm going to them

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:33.200
so we were talking about just builds earlier and problems and stuff it was normally about the temperature I was in about other things oh know about the book but

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.500
you know it's and you'll find out then there's another company

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.500
doing the same job as you will get into your wages

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.700
and you'd find this so because it's something we're coming apart

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.500
let's you dream with this same same same same same job

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:56.700
and then it was when I type of thing would come in a palette so from the same company same company from because we were looking for

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.700
companies that were in

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:03.800
was it rocks Bridge and was the other one Oxford yeah

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.500
and we get this for them and it to show

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.600
somebody it puts his face slip in there

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:14.100
you know we friends out too much they will get they were doing then I'm the same company yeah

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:19.800
so that's why we used to come to a straight then yeah then used to train tail it's the cost of living was more up there

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.300
but it wasn't so good

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.900
so what we were playing

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:30.800
so then we've got just straight with makeup is more money you can get more knowledge because at the time we went to having my charities

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:34.000
so that's what we used to fight for yeah

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:35.100
but all it is

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.000
which they letting water games today

00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:39.700
on today's

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:40.300
did you have

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:42.600
a Christmas Day

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:44.100
which is your lat

00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:46.500
and you'd have thought plate in the summer

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:46.900
yeah

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.500
shut down that shut down yeah

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.900
and that is a lot I think you would get a week

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.900
in October 7 times and then he started going into septembar

00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:57.900
but

00:55:58.700 --> 00:55:59.400
that is your lot

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.000
you had no army bank colleges of course your bank holidays

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.700
which wins so much time no

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:12.700
for men and the four women then because once somebody had left said somebody become

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:14.900
poor man

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:18.700
what they get a bit of themselves then some of them would yes

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:19.900
when it's just left

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.400
yes they would

00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.800
some of them would forget where they come from

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:28.300
you know forget they've been on the shop floor

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:34.700
because it should make them a bit to form and really it shouldn't it if they know the work is like yes

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.600
but no some of them were quite

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:40.600

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.800

because somebody put well I did my

you know things like that yeah

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:11.300
they were getting what I was working more

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:14.100
we had we did have some fun

00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:23.000
or like one day but my friend and on the bloody function of different things you said

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:23.900

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.400
shut me in a cage

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:32.100
everything's got the toilet through me a bucket over you know things like that we used to have gone back set yeah

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:34.800
green we're really good so me today

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.800
yeah and it's still that they work out

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:45.400
properly about the fact you'd be in too hot did you get too cold in the winter yes you got your cold in the winter yeah

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.200
very cold

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:47.800
because

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.800
they changed these gen I think four times when I worked that

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:51.900
you know

00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.200
yeah the gas fires up in the ceiling

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:59.300
then they put in the central heating that didn't work when they'd have to change it

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:05.500
so I think there was spending on the <:-) doing things like that and nothing worked really nothing were no

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.800

not usually lamination box

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.700

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.300

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.800
why is that then to show the boss but to show the bus to us

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:30.300
yes

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.700
and boss you do as I told

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:33.800
your child

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.400
allows you to tell him if you can do this job by doing fgm

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.800
but no no no I couldn't do that never done the job

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.600
so we just tell me how to do it then

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:44.300
you know

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:51.100
changed then when it's stopped being peace work and you want to like a flat rate then is it

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:55.000
what I'm going to bed but there's this from the dad's

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:56.300
no

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.000
you yeah

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.800
they went cheap because

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.500
lots of the music vlog that one time

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:06.800
say they didn't

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.300
but you couldn't blame that mine because

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:16.500
they would win the work and it's just that work at that same thing 50 people in 75

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:25.600
yeah

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.200
and that's what they used to wait it was

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.300
and then when

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:34.000
the other part of the Factory then we'll just yeah

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:36.000
they found it out and then because

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.000
he's here because they already

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.200
know yeah they weren't doing so much plug it

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:49.700
as he call it whatever can you hear me yeah I can't competitors yeah

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:56.700
no you went by yelt on the seats yeah very busy on the national we were very uh

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.100
unionised down there

01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.900
all right on the seat on the seats

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.100
we've been rich yeah with them

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.800
like my husband and we was

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.200
just packing glass wall

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.200
and it was a dangerous job because

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.100
I've been chilling and everything

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.500
let me know I was working with it

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:22.400
because I had to take the work of them to do it yeah and I was really thin would you just more

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.900
thing for me because I was covered in it

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.100
so they sold out there peace work

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.100
he sort of Direct

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.800
but I was still well I had to do it you know what I mean

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.200
that's a reducing one little things little but she thinks yeah

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.500
but shouldn't demand a Japanese able to sort that out

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.100
or would they aware of

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.200
yea to go through the Union all right

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.200
because if anything like that happened

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.800
union would be the Midland man

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:57.200
yeah

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.900
what's a union in a difficult position and you think sometimes no no no

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.500
Union were

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.700
the boss is at that same

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.400
because I mean it was

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.900
the Union was strong very strong at that time

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.800
so I think it was the union and the children management I'm told you mine

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.900
if they didn't think damage things at all

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.600
no no no no

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:22.400
because

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.300
they

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.900
tend to say the unions were too strong back then would you disagree with that

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:30.700
no not really

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.200
no because you

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.200
today you are God's Union

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.800
no you're going to Union today because like I said I went on the Union

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.200
and you would show it

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:43.600
don't make too much vests

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.200
you know you've got to

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:49.000
which I didn't want to do because I mean like I told you a very unionized yeah

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.900
I was very nice

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:53.400
but

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.300
try I couldn't why did you feel like that then did you feel the people

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:01.100
I thought that they can found this video about the people

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:02.500
and I don't like that

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.500
so where's that come from you then just saying

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:10.100
I don't know where they're just gonna put my own backgrounds

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:12.500
and you know

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.700
because my father wasn't again

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:16.100
I think

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.800
maybe because I was taking the same thing at one time

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.500
we are Father there's no working you can't have this

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.500
like it yeah you know

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.900
if I made you stronger I think sure Eddie

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:33.600
okay

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:44.900
just

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.800
ask your bit now you said you know when you went there you met your husband there

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:58.200
so did that work then with both of you being in working in the same place and knowing the same people do you think that made you stronger oh yes because we used to go to the capitals

01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:58.700
yeah

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:00.400
you know they just

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:04.000
the Campus that

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:12.200
make their yeah but we were supposed to them like if you want to cry you go to them yeah and they say welcome to this and

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.900
we all need to go out to the Mars Motors climbing again

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:17.700
you know and it just got

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.100
you followed again with some of them mine

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:24.300
when you're doing your course but it didn't but it wouldn't be for long you know you could make it

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.700
yeah you wouldn't say angry with somebody

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.500
because I can't I got you

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:34.300
make up make up my view like me or you don't like me like I said I make a good friend but I'm exam

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.700
horrible enemy

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.300
so don't make a name in here yeah

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.400
but that's the way I'm gonna do it

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.200
why the makeup friends or me I don't

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:43.700
yeah

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.000
because

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.100
works like crazy today oh yes there's a quote yes

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.400
what about

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.300
but look at

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.600
people's window over time

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.100
over time is a big thing there yeah

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:06.300
what did some people are being given a chance to get more and over time than others

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.300
not their poem on a bit though because

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:14.100
if you're returned to give right you're you've got poor weather and yeah because you have

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:14.400
yeah

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:16.700
so I think they used to her

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:17.600
because

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.400
at one time it was just you were told

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.300
were you working on tonight

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.800
will you do it you know if you could

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.300
if you couldn't then they'd make a festival jets

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.200
it was either

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:36.100
to which I will give it to somebody else for the rest of the week then you know

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.500
so used to try and take it if you could take it

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.900
how many days a week did you work

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.600
buy it but you just started in

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.500
there was no sense is that when someone was there

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.500
no no no they did on Sunday skin

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:54.000
and how many breaks would you have then

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.900
oh when the first step

01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:58.500
you should get your breakfast

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:00.700
and you didn't know

01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:04.300
I don't think you had a break after that because like I said you could smoke

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.500
have a cup of tea on the job yeah

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.900
they bring the tea or you had a tea machine there oh right yeah when they first brought the team machine said

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.399
talked about holidays

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.899
did you ever go on holiday with

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:23.899
people from work yes we still do

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.200
audio yes

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:29.399
little wet yes we've done it for years where did you go

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:32.300
but then we went in the first starting off

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:35.000
then we went to Spain

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.899
we've got to get on well with people to work and go on window

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.200
but I tell you what I'm still friends with my own after

01:08:43.899 --> 01:08:46.300
some of them put your ideas yeah 30 years

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:47.200
so

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.600
you understand each other that yeah

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:51.500
will you more like family

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.800
than your own family

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:55.800
you get me

01:08:58.899 --> 01:09:07.100
and we talked a bit about Christmas at the factory before did people decorate and stuff oh yes we used to decorate

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:10.399
all of a machine that start to stop because of health and safety

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:13.899
but we used to do everything we should put to do

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:17.300
think that you know a little bit less and things on and

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.100
Stream Magic

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.700
drifted to me

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:26.300
so the last cop the cop but make a room decorations

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:32.300
the last book in Dean for Christmas was the best but then was it oh yes

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:34.899
so what time did you don't need a

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:35.399
off yeah

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.600
Christmas was you don't need anything so what time would work

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:41.800
stop on that day well you wouldn't set oh

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.600
so that's where we had an extra day really because

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:52.700
he's a great by 7 bye yep well after seven yes 7 or 27

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.900
but then I think from my present

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.200
then you'd work in about the Upper Street

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.600
and then you start to get another nine oclock

01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:04.000
we open the bars then

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.700
the used to take for kids in and all the boys said

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:12.000
um we'd have a party then for my compound you can't do this to come to this which again

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.400
that's a labor it's just really ends yeah

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:23.500
so it's didn't matter on that day no you don't you work for it anyway all right see that's what I'm saying you should book in

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:24.800
now see you then

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:29.800
400 the day before 200 was for that day and 200 was Far

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:31.300
Christmas Eve

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:31.800
yeah

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:33.800
for new smoking in there yeah

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.200
so you got into their new student you work

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:42.300
tell me a bit more about the social activities in the club because you have like a club post then yeah

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.400
yeah but just in the canteen my night first Saturday then it went to the club

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:46.900
yeah

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:50.000
but in the canteen we used to travel downstairs and things

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:53.200
so what type of thing with your bands and stuff for

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.100
hmm yeah so I think we did have abandoned

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.300
food James

01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.900
and then there's more like a

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.400
records what you call it I could just go there yeah

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.400
man in the records just to win

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:17.100
so Christmas time was there a children's Christmas party they're no we have a pan ziming for them what did you yeah Pennsylvania

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:28.200
I think it is in the January I think there's to do it oh they used to take them to the top of the way give you used to take them yeah

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.300
I'm the old age used to get something out of them yeah no they don't have nothing

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.400
to them now

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.700
that's so bad it's gone

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:41.310
so

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.200
who's going to the club then couples or sitting here

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:50.300
that's a good way to get an opening

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.800
a good way to get to know people out on yourself and yeah

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:06.900
what if you were on a section he was stuck with certain people because you can get on bigger sometimes can't you oh yes we didn't like to love it that's

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:11.500
like I'm saying you couldn't hear them talking anyway unless you look to them

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.800
don't mean it was straight no then we didn't try it and if you weren't being ignorant then

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.400
she'll be waiting maybe chocolate

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.000
you think oh well can you be anyway

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.300
like I can't hear them

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.700
like we just summon up now we're nearly finished

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:36.300
there yes you would shorten I was a member of shooting club there

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:00.400
gosh

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:06.800
all these to draw a bit of everything then it was so there was a miss Morris Motors I miss Lee and yes yeah

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:09.800
because what you can just run when she

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.100
Elaine no Elaine was an attendant or somebody

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:18.800
it was a big thing before I started yeah

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.500
they used to have

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:28.600
MS clemente here miss more response does in the Connecticut yeah they used to have too low risk the maintenance

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.100
yeah

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.900
all they used to be very social at Wednesday

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:41.300
but I think is going to think they got anything though

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.100
also yeah

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.600
like even youngsters don't come to the club with us he says

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:51.500
what do they call them tell me people don't go out as much so they don't know

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:53.700
um

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.300
but to enjoy working at the factory yes I did

01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.400
I did enjoy it

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:01.700
I enjoy the company

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.800
the work was heavy like I said but you got on internet

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.100
and certain jobs I'd enjoy but when I finished that I was whenever work

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.400
I was doing big gradient so

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.400
I think if I had enough finished it with a definition

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:24.000
again you started we were 17 didn't yes they do 60 seconds

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:40.900
and you work then until you have until you are pregnant for the first yeah it only when they had yeah 1971 1971 I went back in 1972 73 in between because Christopher was a year and a bit so that part Time part time identify five years

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:43.000
then I went full time

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.900
then they may just redundant

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.700
then I went back full time

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.100
then and I work full time for five years

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:53.800
as a temp

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:57.300
alright just a temporary contrast yeah

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.700
that's where I was facing against the night for against it yeah

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:03.500
I think that's where they kept me so long

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:16.000
so we're for five years then I went on full time then the contracts then if they if it was a temporary contracted with the did they just keep on renewing the same there was no such thing as time on it oh

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:21.400
no there is mine yeah they got you I think it is used contract now

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:31.500
but I like to turn on your way two years yeah and you yes plan anything less you know finish your

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:38.000
go weekly for the two years yeah another day after yeah you know

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.800
very unfair like that they were yeah

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:44.300
and if they didn't like your face like I say I was too chops here

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.600
and they didn't like my face but

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.500
they kept them having your back they must say

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:50.800
well because of the work yeah

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.500
they knew that I knew the work

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.000
because I started jobs said and they finished them

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.100
you know they'd call me and say yeah

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:02.100
I was doing the Princess and Cardiff went same

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.500
which was a very heavy seat

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.000
that's it off

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.000
they went to finish it up then because they were sending it to another company yeah

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.300
will you come and finish them for me

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I used to go

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:17.600
that's everything you know yeah so when did you finish eventually then

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.100
2006

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:23.800
so how did you feel about

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:27.600
when they had an accident before I finished all right

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:29.400
a slipped

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.600
my leg I'm taking your hospital carried out on the stretcher

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.800
never knew I'd be done doing that though

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:42.900
and that's why finish them and then they had married and see which they weren't willing to give me

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:52.200
but I have major in general- because you've been on a temporary company 20 years yeah 14 then

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.300
so they were afraid

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:58.500
not to give it to me because I told him I take them to court

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.400
that they couldn't stop it anyway because I mean I put in for it to do something yeah

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:05.000
you know

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:07.400
I'm gonna be young for this

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.600
no you're not doing that no you say oh no I might see it it's a matter

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:17.300
it's not what you say you don't really know it's not like you can

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.200
there's more things happen to be one and be there because I was

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:26.100
staying in the same place very important only two jobs I have I went yeah

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:28.000
so you

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:29.100
finished

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:30.100
it was

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:40.100
it because of your leg or were you ready to go and anyway no I was going to finish I need that again for my return let's say right but I do only put in to see because everybody's finishing yeah

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.100
but when I felt a lot put the 10 lit on it

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.000
I thought they couldn't work after that anyway no

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.400
you know because I did about two months before we can never

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.900
because I had a big I had a big bang yeah

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:55.300
um

01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:00.100
what does struck me right talked into a lot of women now is that

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.400
they have

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:02.600
worked

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.600
clothes with the women

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:08.700
and sometimes ONE Event sticks in the mind like

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.200
something the experience the same time as somebody else like

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.800
one of the girls in the valley she

01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:23.500
said she remembers here but I'm advanced that type of thing yeah and another one

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.700
was not shoulder than you but she remembered here in

01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:36.100
the Queen getting married on the radio the fact they stopped the factory and they played it on the radio for everybody to listen to all they don't tools

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.200
is there anything

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:44.000
any event that comes to mind when you think about the factory a particular day you're anything like that

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:46.100
oh no not really

01:18:46.900 --> 01:19:03.100
do anything they could done the factory on the town I was when I was in this message yeah that's only one thing we remember that all right

01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:07.700
there's something coming over the town right

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:12.000
you remember any visit by anybody

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:12.500
you know

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.800
there was no one nobody would you call it a Japanese camera around

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:20.400

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:25.900

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:30.800
and they stay right up for a long time

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.900
and he went to pick it up when I went to jail and I thought

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:35.400
